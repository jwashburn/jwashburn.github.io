      <h1>This story took its first breath when I was 5.</h1>
    
    
    <p>After I watched my friend’s older sister play the original <i>Legend of Zelda</i>, I stole some wood from our neighbor’s woodpile and hammered together a wooden sword.</p>
<p>I used it to slay imaginary dragons. Then I’d tuck it in the back of my shirt as I hung off the edge of the balcony with make-believe lava below.</p>

    </div>

<br />



<p>I couldn’t get enough of adventure stories.</p> 
<p>This problem followed me into my adulthood: <strong>I wanted more LUKE SKYWALKER, more AVATAR AANG, more SAMWISE THE BRAVE.</strong></p> 
    <p>You know what I’m talking about! </p>
<p>When it’s a book you love, you just can’t get enough.</p>

  <img src="images/screenshot1.jpg" alt="Twitter was lighting up about SONG OF LOCKE." />
        <br />

<p>At the end of 2014, I launched a Kickstarter. <strong>Hundreds of backers pledged thousands of dollars,</strong> enabling me to write and publish SONG OF LOCKE.</p>

    <br />
  <img src="images/screenshot2.jpg" alt="Twitter was lighting up about SONG OF LOCKE." />
    
    

<h1>This story breaks all the rules.</h1>

<p>I knew it had to have certain elements, and that meant following a familiar formula, the one that had inspired my childhood:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A boy on a <strong>daring quest</strong></li>
      <li>With a <strong>magical sword</strong></li>
      <li>To rescue an <strong>enchanting princess</strong> </li>
      <li>From a <strong>fallen god</strong> </li>
    </ul>

    <p>I’d seen these elements in many stories, including <i>Legend of Zelda</i>, <i>Peter Pan</i>, and <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. Not only were they parts of a successful pattern, but they were part of what I just couldn’t get enough of! </p>

<p>Unfortunately, I’d been disappointed by many books, movies, and games. Ones that talked the talk but didn’t walk the walk. And the last thing I wanted was a book full of tropes but without any heart, without any soul.</p>


     <ul>
<li class="bullet-no">No, it’s not another boring cliche.</li>
<p>My favorites became favorites because they had depth. My book needed <strong>rich characters, a colorful magic system, and an unforgettable setting</strong>. </p>

<li class="bullet-no">No, it doesn’t rip-off the classics.</li>
<p>My story would stand on the shoulders of those who’d gone before, drawing on their powers and then reaching to higher heights thanks to their help. </p>

<li class="bullet-yes">YES—it’s an unexpected addition to a long tradition!</li>
<p>My story needed deep emotional themes, ones that would <strong>resonate with modern readers</strong>, including things I had personally struggled with. It had to be real. </p>
    </ul>

    
<p>This wasn’t my first rodeo, but writing a book is always a ton of work. I buckled down, skipping parties, delaying work, and passing on vacations. Because I had to finish. I had to deliver what I’d promised. </p>
<p>I launched the paperback at the end of 2015.</p>

<h1>Introducing...</h1>
    
    <br />
    
    <div class="book">

  <img src="images/song-of-locke-paperback.png" alt="SONG OF LOCKE paperback" />



      <p><strong>BACK FLAP:</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Locke is an elfe</strong> who feels a strange, magical longing for something that he can’t quite describe.</p>

      <p>His sylfe <strong>Picke, a fairy-like creature</strong>, dares him to follow a band of bloodthirsty warriors into the woods, promising they’ll lead to the thing Locke longs for. </p>

<p>Mustering his courage, Locke takes the dare, and the two of them find themselves on a wild adventure. <strong>Soon Locke must face snarling wolves, wield a magic blade, and risk his life to rescue a goddess</strong>—a girl he hardly knows but who he can’t stop thinking about—from the clutches of a fallen god.</p>

      <p>In the spirit of <i>Legend of Zelda</i> and <i>Peter Pan</i>, SONG OF LOCKE takes place in <strong>a detailed and gritty fantasy world drenched in human emotion</strong>. The story has sword fights, witty banter, crushes, and even some subtle philosophy smuggled in. It’s an epic for everyone who loves good stories—for anyone who has longed for something that seemed forever out of reach.</p>

<h1>It’s an indie book.</h1>

<p>The crazy thing is that this book wasn’t published by a behemoth and funded with corporate money. It happened thanks to the funding of people like you. </p>
<p>Real people.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for that little miracle.</p> 
<p>It allowed me to become an indie (independent) author. That’s like being an indie band, where you don’t sign with big label. The only difference is that indie authors have more groupies.</p>
<p>This help from my awesome fans allowed me to create an artisan book—written, illustrated, and typeset by the author, a masterpiece handcrafted from beginning to end. </p>
    <p><strong>Yes, that includes the illustrations!</strong></p>

<h1>Who is this kid? </h1>

<p>I’m new in these parts. </p>
<p>You probably haven’t heard of me before today, but I promise it won’t be the last time.</p>
<p>My name’s J. </p>
<p>Nope, not J-A-Y. And not even J with a period. (Abbreviating my name actually makes it longer.) It starts and ends with J. </p>

<p>Before I wrote SONG OF LOCKE, I wrote a book called ECKSDOT.</p>
    <p>They say it’s <i>The Sandlot</i> meets <i>Inception</i>. </p>
<p>Who’s “they”? </p>
<p>Well, they’re a lot of people. But one of them is this guy, who paid me a pretty awesome compliment: </p>

      <div class="quote">
<p>“My personal favorite is the way he describes sounds visually. <strong>I’ve never read anything like that before. It took my breath away.</strong> I re-read those descriptions several times before moving on just for the pure beauty of it.” </p>

<p>“I had several late nights because I couldn’t stop reading. <strong>The imagery is beautiful, the characters are lovable, and the story is just plain fun.</strong> The interaction between Locke and Picke is always entertaining and made me both laugh and think deeply about life.” </p>

<p>“The writing style is quite fluid. The dynamic between Picke and Locke is entertaining. <strong>The opening was nostalgic for me, having played <i>Ocarina of Time</i> so often.</strong> Also, it’s divided into scrolls, which makes the story feel older, like it’s <i>in</i> another world, not just <i>about</i> another world.”</p>
