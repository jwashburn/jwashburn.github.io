      <h1>STARCHILD is <br /> an artisan book.</h1>
    
    
    <p>That means one author (me) <strong>painstakingly crafted everything from the cover illustration to the final period.</strong></b></p> 
    <p>Because I didn't have a publishing company bossing me around, I put in everything that I love, and I think you will love it too: </b></p>
	<ul> 
      <li>The story dives deep into the minds of an <strong>UNFORGETTABLE CAST</strong> of lovable (and loathable) characters, including flawed heroines and deep villains.</li>
      <li> The <strong>GALACTIC SETTING</strong> is exquisite, and it’s based on actual scientific discoveries, with worlds like you’ve never imagined but which likely exist in our own galaxy.</li>
      <li>The marvels of the <strong>MAGIC SYSTEM</strong> will make you envious, and its basis in fact might have you personally testing whether it’s real. </li>
      <li>The story itself is a <strong>FAST-PACED RIDE</strong> that will leave you hungry for more adventure, and luckily, the sequel is already here. </li>
      <li>For readers who are sick of stories with thoughtless, cheap thrills, STARCHILD is a novel that both <strong>ENTERTAINS and ENLIGHTENS</strong>. 
	</ul>
<p>Get ready for a reading addiction like you HAVEN’T EXPERIENCED SINCE YOU WERE A KID.<br /></p>
<p>The moment you open the book, you’ll be transported away at lightspeed.<br /></p>
<p>SO, ARE YOU READY to take an intergalactic leap? <br /></p>

<p class="bluewin">“A masterpiece <br/>handcrafted from beginning to end.”<br /></p>
<p>Being an indie (independent) author is like being in an indie band, where you don’t sign with big label. Only difference is, I have more groupies.<br /></p>
<p>Yes, I did the illustrations too! <br /></p>

      <h4>Flying an ancient alien spaceship, STARCHILD may have the key to saving the rebels. Only he wants no part of their war... until he meets HER.<br /></h4>

      <center><p>* * *<br /></p></center>

	<p>Tyranny rules the galaxy. <br /></p>
	<p>TAIBEROS has crushed every hint of rebellion. Like the grip of his cybernetic hand, he maintains a relentless hold on the populace. The power he hates most is the psionic magic of THE SONG—a force so strong it flows out as light from the eyes. People with such powers are called RADIANCES, and Taiberos’s Witch Hunters kidnap any that surface.<br /></p> 
	<p>As the radiances slowly vanish, so does the galaxy’s hope. <br /></p>
	<p>Till Kalhette Whitesun, one of the last radiances, gives a risky speech, denouncing Taiberos and the extermination of her kind. The message spreads across the galaxy like the light of a supernova. She becomes revered as the UNCROWNED QUEEN, the one with the power to finally unite the people. <br /></p>
	<p>And then doom falls—<br /></p>
	<p>In the form of the crushing hand of Taiberos. He captures Kalhette, sentencing her to the darkest dungeons and imminent death. <br /></p>
	<p>All hope is lost. <br /></p>
	<p>Until a lone pilot appears. A pilot who wants nothing to do with Kalhette or her rebellion yet who may in fact be the galaxy’s last hope. A pilot whose ship, THE SPIRIT, was created by an ancient alien race. A pilot who stole that ship from Taiberos himself... <br /></p>
	<p>A renegade pilot named STARCHILD. <br /></p>

<p>You probably haven’t heard of me before now, but I promise it won’t be the last time. I'm J Washburn.</p>
<p>Nope, not J-A-Y. And not even J with a period. It starts and ends with J.</p>
<p>You can read more about me on Amazon and Google. In the meantime, I'll just share with you one quick endorsement from this guy:</p>

<h1>The Big Guarantee</h1>

	<p>I know you're a real person with real problems, same as me. And I know you have that little skeptic in your head saying you might not like it--might not find it worth the money. The bottom line is that I believe in STARCHILD, and the reviews make me <b>confident that you'll not just like it but love it</b>. If not, I still want you to have an excellent experience buying epic stories from me. So here's the promise: <br /></p>
    <div class="youwin"><p>If you read these novels and don't like them, <br /><b>I WILL GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK.</b><br /></p> </div>
	<p>That's a promise. <br /></p>
	<p>And it means there's no risk for you. <br /></p>
	<p> I will refund your money if you don't like the story. Simple as that. If that isn't enough to convince you, shoot me an email, and we'll talk it over more. Seriously.<br /></p>
