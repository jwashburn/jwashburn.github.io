      <h1>STARCHILD is <br /> an artisan book.</h1>
    
    
    <p>That means one author (me) <strong>painstakingly crafted everything from the cover illustration to the final period.</strong></b></p> 
    <p>Because I didn't have a publishing company bossing me around, I put in everything that I love, and I think you will love it too: </b></p>
	<ul> 
      <li>The story dives deep into the minds of an <strong>UNFORGETTABLE CAST</strong> of lovable (and loathable) characters, including flawed heroines and deep villains.</li>
      <li> The <strong>GALACTIC SETTING</strong> is exquisite, and it’s based on actual scientific discoveries, with worlds like you’ve never imagined but which likely exist in our own galaxy.</li>
      <li>The marvels of the <strong>MAGIC SYSTEM</strong> will make you envious, and its basis in fact might have you personally testing whether it’s real. </li>
      <li>The story itself is a <strong>FAST-PACED RIDE</strong> that will leave you hungry for more adventure, and luckily, the sequel is already here. </li>
      <li>For readers who are sick of stories with thoughtless, cheap thrills, STARCHILD is a novel that both <strong>ENTERTAINS and ENLIGHTENS</strong>. 
	</ul>
<p>Get ready for a reading addiction like you HAVEN’T EXPERIENCED SINCE YOU WERE A KID.<br /></p>
<p>The moment you open the book, you’ll be transported away at lightspeed.<br /></p>
<p>SO, ARE YOU READY to take an intergalactic leap? <br /></p>

          <p>My brother holds a magical flute <br />and the sword I made when I was 5.</p>
    </div>

<br />

<p>I couldn’t get enough of adventure stories.</p> 
<p>This problem followed me into my adulthood: <b>I wanted more LUKE SKYWALKER, more AVATAR AANG, more SAMWISE THE BRAVE.</b></p> 
    <p>You know what I’m talking about!—when it’s a book you love, you just can’t get enough.</p>

  <img src="images/screenshot1.jpg" alt="Twitter was lighting up about SONG OF LOCKE." />
        <br />

<p>At the end of 2014, I launched a Kickstarter. <b>Hundreds of backers pledged thousands of dollars,</b> enabling me to write and publish SONG OF LOCKE.</p>

    <br />
  <img src="images/screenshot2.jpg" alt="Twitter was lighting up about SONG OF LOCKE." />
    
    




<h1>Unconventionally conventional</h1>

<p>I wanted to include some familiar elements, like the stories that inspired my childhood:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A boy on a <b>daring quest</b></li>
      <li>With a <b>magical sword</b></li>
      <li>To rescue an <b>enchanting princess</b> </li>
      <li>From a <b>fallen god</b> </li>
    </ul>

<p>Unfortunately, I’d been disappointed by books, movies, and games that talked the talk but didn’t walk the walk. The last thing I wanted was a book full of tropes without any soul.</p>

     <ul>
<li class="bullet-no">No, it’s not another boring cliche.</li>
<p>I infused my book with <b>rich characters, a colorful magic system, and an unforgettable setting</b>. </p>

<li class="bullet-no">No, it doesn’t rip-off the classics.</li>
<p>I certainly started with the classics as a guide, but <b>I drew on their powers then reached higher</b> thanks to their help.</p>

<li class="bullet-yes">YES—it’s an unexpected addition to a long tradition!</li>
<p>This story weaves in deep emotional themes, ones that <b>resonate with modern readers</b>, including things I'd personally struggled with.</p>
    </ul>

    
<p>This wasn’t my first rodeo, but writing a book is always hard. I skipped parties, delayed income, and passed on vacations. Because I had to finish. I had to deliver what I promised. </p>
<p>I launched the paperback at the end of 2015.</p>

<h1>Introducing...</h1>
    
    <br />
    
    <div class="book">

  <img src="images/song-of-locke-paperback.png" alt="SONG OF LOCKE paperback" />


      <p><b>BACK FLAP:</b></p>

      <p><b>Locke is an elfe</b> who feels a strange, magical longing for something that he can’t quite describe.</p>

      <p>His sylfe <b>Picke, a fairy-like creature</b>, dares him to follow a band of bloodthirsty warriors into the woods, promising they’ll lead to the thing Locke longs for. </p>

<p>Mustering his courage, Locke takes the dare, and the two of them find themselves on a wild adventure. <b>Soon Locke must face snarling wolves, wield a magic blade, and risk his life to rescue a goddess</b>—a girl he hardly knows but who he can’t stop thinking about—from the clutches of a fallen god.</p>

      <p>In the spirit of <i>Legend of Zelda</i> and <i>Peter Pan</i>, SONG OF LOCKE takes place in <b>a detailed and gritty fantasy world drenched in human emotion</b>. The story has sword fights, witty banter, crushes, and even some subtle philosophy smuggled in. It’s an epic for everyone who loves good stories—for anyone who has longed for something that seemed forever out of reach.</p>

<h1>It’s an indie book.</h1>

<p>Being an indie (independent) author is like being in an indie band, where you don’t sign with big label. The only difference is that I have more groupies.</p>
<p>Fans like you allowed me to create an artisan book—written, illustrated, and typeset by the author, a masterpiece handcrafted from beginning to end. </p>
    <p><b>Yes, I did the illustrations too!</b></p>

<h1>Who is this kid? </h1>

<p>You probably haven’t heard of me before today, but I promise it won’t be the last time.</p>

  <img src="images/J-Washburn-author-portrait.jpg" alt="J Washburn, author of SONG OF LOCKE and ECKSDOT" />

<p>Nope, not J-A-Y. And not even J with a period. It starts and ends with J. </p>

<p>You can read more about me on Amazon and Google. In the meantime, I'll just share with you one quick endorsement from this guy:</p>
